# Description

This is a flutter app integrated with Google Place API to retreive nearby places.

It is always a headache for me to decide what to eat for lunch, so I developed this app to provide myself some random suggestions.

## Getting Started

For help getting started with Flutter, view online
[documentation](https://flutter.io/).

## How to use

Setup flutter project, download the code. Change YOUR_API_KEY to your google API key. Then you are good to go.
